# hello-world

Hi, I'm Trey. I love coding a lot. 
I'm always found in my small room coding and drinking some coffee.
Code is life and a unit of everything in this world.
I'm aiming at creating a new language or software which is an answer to everything.
i urge every being on earth to learn some coding b'cos, you're gonna love it.
